        Let's look at the Ivorian culture. 
        C么te d'Ivoire is a West African country. Its administrative and historical capital is Yamoussoukro, but the most important city and therefore the economic capital is Abidjan.

    <h2>The Monuments and Places</h2>

    <p> 
        In terms of monuments and places to visit in C么te d'Ivoire, there is the Saint Paul's cathedral, in the Plateau, which is the business district of Abidjan. The Banco forest, which is the lung of Abidjan and home to forest elephants, monkeys, ect and the Basilica of Our Lady of Peace in Yamoussoukro, has its dome inspired by the Basilica of St Peter in Rome.

    <h2>The Places for Relaxation</h2>

    <p> 
        When I think of holidays in Abidjan, one place that comes to mind first is Assinie. So, Assinie is a seaside resort at 45min drive from Abidjan, and it's a real paradise on earth between the sea on one side and the lagoon on the other, which is a very calm river.
